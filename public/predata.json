Drain and discard the soaking liquid. Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth.\r\n\r\nCold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other. Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan. Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips. Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours. When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.\r\n\r\nIf you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher. To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container. Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight. When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise. If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat. There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.\r\n\r\nThe mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail. \r\n\r\nHabanero tincture\r\n\r\nSlice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.\r\nAllow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.\r\nCocktail\r\n\r\nCombine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.\r\nStrain into chilled coupe.\r\nCarefully \"sink\" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.\r\nGarnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.","ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Mezcal","measurement":"2","measureType":"oz"},{"ingredient":"Chocolate liqueur","measurement":"3/4","measureType":"oz"},{"ingredient":"Coffee liqueur","measurement":"1/2","measureType":"oz"}]},{"id":"17212","drink":"Espresso Martini","drinkThumb":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/n0sx531504372951.jpg","imageSource":null,"drinkAlternate":null,"tags":"IBA,NewEra","category":"Cocktail","iba":"New Era Drinks","alcoholic":"Alcoholic","glass":"Cocktail glass","instructions":"Pour ingredients into shaker filled with ice, shake vigorously, and strain into chilled martini glass","ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Vodka","measurement":"5","measureType":"cl"},{"ingredient":"Kahlua","measurement":"1","measureType":"cl"},{"ingredient":"Sugar syrup","measurement":"1","measureType":"dash"}]},{"id":"178309","drink":"Espresso Rumtini","drinkThumb":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/acvf171561574403.jpg","imageSource":null,"drinkAlternate":null,"tags":"DinnerParty,StrongFlavor","category":"Cocktail","iba":null,"alcoholic":"Alcoholic","glass":"Cocktail glass","instructions":"Mix together in a cocktail glass.
